# PropHunt Bounty System Addon

Welcome to the **PropHunt Bounty System Addon**! This addon enhances the PropHunt gamemode in Garry's Mod by introducing a dynamic bounty system. The addon adds a layer of excitement and competition by assigning bounties to random prop players at the start of each round. Hunters are rewarded for eliminating bounty props, while surviving bounty props earn rewards for their cunning evasion.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bounties**: At the beginning of each round, a random prop player is assigned a bounty.
- **Point Rewards**:
  - **For Hunters**: Points are awarded for successfully eliminating the bounty prop.
  - **For Props**: If a bounty prop survives the round, they earn the bounty points.
- **Balanced Gameplay**: Adds a strategic element to the classic PropHunt gamemode without disrupting its core mechanics.
- **Customizable** (optional): Supports easy configuration for point values and bounty assignment logic (if implemented).

## Installation

1. Download the addon from this repository.
2. Place the extracted folder into your Garry's Mod `addons` directory.
3. Restart your Garry's Mod server to load the addon.
4. Configure settings if applicable by editing the configuration file.

## How It Works

1. At the start of each PropHunt round:
   - A random prop player is assigned as the **bounty target**.
   - All players are notified about the bounty.
2. **For Hunters**:
   - If a Hunter eliminates the bounty target, they earn the assigned points.
3. **For Bounty Props**:
   - If the bounty target survives until the end of the round, they earn the bounty points.
4. Scores are updated in real-time, adding an extra layer of competition to the match.
